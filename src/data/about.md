I have worked for large MNCs, such as Adjust GmbH, PTC Inc., and Persistent Systems Limited. As of March 2025, I have more than 12 years of technical writing experience, and have contributed to 7+ Help Centers, around 1000 articles, and 15+ user and install guides. I have extensive experience in writing technical Help Center documentation, SDK and API documentation, help manuals, release notes, and UX copy. Over the course of my career, I have worked on writing for completely new products, building the information architecture, designing content strategy and flow, as well as maintaining and updating existing documentation.

My primary purpose towards creating good content is providing help to customers when they need it the most. I believe that clear, structured documentation can bridge the gap between technical teams and end-users.

I take pride in my attention to detail and my ability to see the bigger picture. My process isn’t just about writing documents; it’s about solving real-world challenges with clear, actionable guidance. As a Senior Technical Writer, I possess the following strengths:

- I have an eye for detail and perfect any task that I take up with complete dedication.
- I am not afraid of taking up any challenges at work and enjoy them as it motivates me to work harder and become better at my job.
- I thrive under tight deadlines, and never fail to deliver on time with the highest quality. 
- I am able to build a good professional rapport with my colleagues, which enables me to effectively share and receive information with team members and stakeholders.

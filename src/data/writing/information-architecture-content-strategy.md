Information architecture and content flow involves structuring and organizing content in a way that makes the information easy to find, understand, and navigate.

### Information architecture: My work at Adjust

I worked extensively on setting up the information architecture of the Adjust Help Center independently, when we moved from the legacy product to the new Adjust product. In addition, I revamped the information architecture of multiple sections within the Adjust Help Center.

### Content flow: My work at Adjust

It is also important to pay attention to how information flows within individual articles. You do not want to overwhelm the user too much, but you also do not want to skip any information. Too many images means a lot of scrolling, horizontally or vertically, and skipping images completely would possibly not be beneficial to certain users. Knowing the audience is key to writing content that flows smoothly and is easy to grasp. 

__Subscriptions__

I worked on creating a new section for Adjust's Subscriptions solution. This section was highly appreciated by the Product Manager and Sales teams. Clients were able to independently set up the feature without requiring any assistance from Adjust Technical Account Managers.

__SDK integration guides__

I worked on creating a template for getting started with and setting up the Adjust SDK with a client's app. Content in this single article has links to everything that a developer would need to get set up.

User journey documentation involves mapping the steps that a user needs to take when interacting with a product, from the initial touchpoint to the desired goal. It needs to be an integral part of the documentation strategy irrespective of whether a user needs to only run through a specific feature of the product or access multiple features of a product to accomplish their goal. It aligns perfectly with "tutorials" in the Di√°taxis approach to documentation. 

Creating user journeys is a great way for multiple stakeholders to collaborate and identify pain points and optimize the flow to make the user experience as seamless as possible. Documenting user journeys well can improve product adoption and onboarding, and reduce touchdowns with support.

### My work at Adjust 

At Adjust GmbH, I worked with the cross-functional team to outline the steps that a Marketing Manager for an Educational app needs to take to analyze how successful their campaigns are in driving users to the app.

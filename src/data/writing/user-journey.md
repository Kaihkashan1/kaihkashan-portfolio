User journey documentation involves mapping the steps that a user needs to take when interacting with a product, from the initial touchpoint to the desired goal. It should be an integral part of the documentation strategy, whether a user interacts with a single feature or multiple features to achieve their goal. This approach aligns well with the 'tutorials' category in the Di√°taxis framework."

The way we document a user journey depends on the target audience. It's essential to understand which assumptions we can and cannot make. 

Creating user journeys is a great way for multiple stakeholders to collaborate and identify pain points and optimize the flow to make the user experience as seamless as possible. Well-documented user journeys improve product adoption, streamline onboarding, and reduce the burden on support teams.

### My work at Adjust

I collaborated with cross-functional teams to define the user journey for an education app, LearnDroid.
1. The steps a user follows to subscribe to the app.
2. The steps a Marketing Manager needs to take to analyze how successful their campaigns are in driving users to the app.
